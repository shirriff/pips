# Solve the New York Times Pips puzzles using the MiniZinc constraint solver

The New York Times has a puzzle called Pips, where you put dominoes on a grid.
I explain how to use the MiniZinc constraint-solving software to solve the puzzle
in my [blog post](https://www.righto.com/2025/10/solve-nyt-pips-with-constraints.html).

This repository holds programs to solve some of the puzzles.
